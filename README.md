# Master Hook Playground

 That is a representation of how you can use [master-hook](https://github.com/opium-pro/master-hook) package

for the begining:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/opium-pro/master-hook-playground.git
 cd master-hook-playground
 
 npm i
 npm start
 ```

 We use `themeor` package here just to keep the styling simple, it's not necessary for `master-hook`
